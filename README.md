# The Inside Shed

Welcome to The Inside Shed — a digital space where I share my journey through the evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence. Here, I document my experiments, insights, and learnings as I shape and mold AI systems, turning abstract ideas into tangible applications.

## About Me
I am a Psychologist, a PhD student specializing in Health Data Science, and an AI Modeler. I am also working on modeling AI through the concept of conditioning, drawing inspiration from foundational psychology concepts. My research focuses on the intersection of synthetic data, AI, and healthcare, particularly understanding how emerging technologies can improve decision-making and well-being. As an AI Modeler, my work includes:
- Designing, training, and refining machine learning models, with a focus on predictive analytics and model fine-tuning.
- Utilizing psychological principles to develop human-centered AI systems.
- Creating synthetic data to simulate complex health scenarios, ensuring privacy and ethical standards in data science.

The Inside Shed is more than just a collection of projects; it's a space where curiosity meets critical reflection. I explore how AI can augment human adaptability, promote ethical use, and contribute to fields like healthcare and education.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Experiment Logs**: Documentation of AI experiments, ranging from model development to data-driven decision support.
- **Insights and Reflections**: Introspective pieces on the role of psychology in AI, and how these technologies can align with human values.
- **Crafted and Half-Crafted Ideas**: Exploratory concepts, some complete and others in various stages of development, serving as starting points for the next iteration and inviting further thought and experimentation.
